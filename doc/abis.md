# ABIs

The SDK exposes LooksRareAggregator's contract ABI. If you need other ABIs, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/LooksRare/sdk-aggregator/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=).

```ts
import {
  LooksRareAggregatorAbi
} from "@looksrare/sdk-aggregator";
```

You can also export the JSON file directly:

import LooksRareAggregatorAbi from "@looksrare/sdk-aggregator/dist/abis/LooksRareAggregator.json";
